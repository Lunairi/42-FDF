# 42-FDF
First graphic project, wireframe graphic for 42. My very first time delving ever into the concept of graphics.

Not my best work, at this time it shows clearly the lack of understanding and immaturity with my coding. Much of this project was me learning how to use a specialize library called MLX, and understanding the algorithm and concepts behind creating a graphic engine.
